# GUIs for Python - improving the accessibility of research software 
 
Research software has been a driving force behind the birth and rapid growth of informatics, but it was the appearance of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in the 1980s that made computers accessible to everyone. A GUI helps to reduce the learning curve for using software, increases the base of potential users and can ultimately increase citations and impact. Moreover, a well-designed GUI can perform validation and increase the robustness and reproducibility of the results, productively decoupling developers from users. 
 
This repository contains simple examples on using three GUI frameworks (Jupyter Widgets, Kivy and Tkinter) to perform the same tasks. A handy [cheatsheet](docs/cheatsheet.md) has been created providing quick access to a range of information for the three frameworks.
