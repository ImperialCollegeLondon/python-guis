# Cheatsheet for Jupyter Widgets, Tkinter and Kivy

This document shows the (rough) equivalence between the main widgets in the three GUI frameworks. While the functionality is somewhat similar, their inputs and how they are used or packed together might differ substantially.

This is by no means an exhaustive lists of widgets (in particular for Kivy, which has an extensive list of specialised widgets) but just a few common ones that work in a similar way in the three frameworks.
